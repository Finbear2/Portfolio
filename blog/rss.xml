        <p style="font-size: 18px;">
            <span style="font-size: 32px;"><b>Maingear has started selling bring-your-own-RAM PCs because this world values RAM more than human blood.</b></span><br/><br/>

            According to the media, AI companies are buying up vast amounts of RAM so they shove chatGPT into your kettle and eventually charge you a monthly fee.<br/><br/>

            RAM now costs more than a 5070, more than a newborn and more than blood by weight. The substance that is keeping all living things alive is less expensive
            than computer memory. It’s probably more expensive than human memory as well but my search history is already concerning enough trying to research how much
            blood costs.<br/><br/>

            The funny thing is, this all because of an unstable bubble that is about to pop.<br/><br/>

            For now, buying ram is worse than investing in a meme coin… somehow<br/><br/>
